        <h1>Welcome to my little corner of the internet!</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I'm Morgan, and this is an ongoing project of mine! <br>
        In an attempt to showcase ALLLL my coding skills, frontend, middleend, and backend, I've elected to create this <br>
        github-hosted website with some fun bits and pieces to do and see, that help get my personality across <br>
        <br>
        TLDR?<br>
        Job applications ain't working, so trying this instead, welcome to chaos!</p>
